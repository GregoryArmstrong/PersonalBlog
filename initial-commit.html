      <p>Being a student at Turing has been a spectacular experience so far. I had not imagined myself to be a software developer prior to the summer of 2015, but have found I am happier learning how to program than I have been with any previous endeavor.</p>
      <p>I was apprehensive at first because all my previous work experience was in medical research or in the hospitality industry. I've always enjoyed working with and building computers, and have grown up learning quite a bit from the web, but had not thought a career in software development was within reach. I was not willing to undergo another Bachelor's Degree program for computer science due to financial and time constraints. However, Turing has fit the bill for exactly the type of program I was looking to attend, and has proven in the first Module to be quite a rewarding challenge.</p>
      <p>I eagerly await what we'll be learning in Module 2, as creating web sites with a more tangible feel will add a new rewarding element to the work we're all doing.</p>
